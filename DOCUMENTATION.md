## Approach
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?

How I first approched this was just to set up the environment correctly and make sure that it ran the way that I expected it to.*

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

## Problems Faced
*I initially faced a couple of problems setting up the project as when i followed the instuctions on the git to set up the environment it was missing a part on how to make sure that the project would update my git repo instead of the original one that it was cloned on and this was the error it gave "fatal: The current branch has no upstream branch". The solution to this was to "git push -u origin main" which pushed all the curerent files to my project but also enmsured that all the new code I wrote would also go there. I also faced another problem where the interpreter was not working correctly even after installing the depndencies correctly. The way I fixed this was select new interpreter, go to the files of the project and find python.exe in the Scripts folder. Another problem I faced was when I did the average price function in main.py this is because when it tries and add up all the prices it still adds up even when it says null which causes it to not work as expected, to fix this I made a list of all the prices and when it finds one that says null it just ignores it. *

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*
